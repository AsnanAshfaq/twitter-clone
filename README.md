## Amazon Clone

## How to Run the Project?
First move to the root directory 

Then run 
**npm install**
This command will install the dependencies in the *package.json* file which are necessary for the project to run
After that, Run 

**npm start**
This command will start the react app locally on PORT 3000
#### But that is not enough to make the whole project running

## Running Cloud Functions
This project is using the Firebase Cloud Functions to handle the backend process of Stripe Payment 
In order to run the Cloud Functions
#### Open up a new Terminal
go to the functions folder presend inside the root directory of the project and Run
**firebase emulators:start**

# Make Sure you have firebase CLI installed in your system

## And THATS IT !!!!
You can now test the Amazon Clone and make sure to use the Test Card number.
To use the Test Card, just keep on typing type **42** in the input fied of the payment page and then press **ENTER**

# HAPPY HACKING
