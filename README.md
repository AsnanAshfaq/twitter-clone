## How to Run the Project Locally?
First move to the root directory 

Then run 
**npm install**
This command will install the dependencies in the *package.json* file which are necessary for the project to run
After that, Run 

**npm start**
This command will start the react app locally on PORT 3000

# OR you can directly visit the deployed app by using the below link
